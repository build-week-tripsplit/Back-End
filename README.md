# Trip Split - Back-End

Instead of scrambling at the end of a trip or a dinner to figure out who pays for what, Trip Split keeps things simple. Everything is divided equally and thereâ€™s no more guessing game involved. No need to whip out the calculator on your iPhone after an uber ride and you can plan out trips in advance so youâ€™re always on budget.
